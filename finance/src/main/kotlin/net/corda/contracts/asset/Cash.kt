/**
 * A cash transaction may split and merge money represented by a set of (issuer, depositRef) pairs, across multiple
 * input and output states. Imagine a Bitcoin transaction but in which all UTXOs had a colour
 * (a blend of issuer+depositRef) and you couldn't merge outputs of two colours together, but you COULD put them in
 * the same transaction.
 *
 * The goal of this design is to ensure that money can be withdrawn from the ledger easily: if you receive some money
 * via this contract, you always know where to go in order to extract it from the R3 ledger, no matter how many hands
 * it has passed through in the intervening time.
 *
 * At the same time, other contracts that just want money and don't care much who is currently holding it in their
 * vaults can ignore the issuer/depositRefs and just examine the amount fields.
